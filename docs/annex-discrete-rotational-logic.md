## Quaternions for Discrete Rotational Logic

Using **quaternions for discrete rotational steps** opens up a fascinating new lens for modeling **symbolic logic, cyclical systems, and state machines**, especially those that benefit from *non-linear transitions, reversible paths, or orientation-preserving structure*. 
In a discrete system, instead of continuously rotating in 3D space, you step through **predefined orientations**. Think of it like moving around a cube, tetrahedron, or more abstract “orientation graph.”

## 1. **Symbolic Logic as Rotational States**

Imagine symbolic logic gates (like AND, OR, XOR) not as static boxes, but as **rotation gates** between logical states.

* Each **logical state** (true/false, 0/1) is a *node* in orientation space.
* A **quaternion rotation** between states represents the application of a logical operator or inference rule.

### Example:

* `q_AND` rotates state A and B into a new state C (A ∧ B).
* Rotations can be reversible (∧ ↔ inference), and chaining quaternion operations resembles **compositional logic**.

## 2. **Cyclical Processes & Quaternion Loops**

Quaternions are particularly good at modeling **cyclical or periodic systems**:

* Quaternion group algebra (unit quaternions under multiplication) inherently forms a **non-commutative group** — ideal for modeling cycles that aren’t reversible in simple ways.
* Examples:

  * Cellular automata with non-Euclidean spatial steps
  * Biological or ecological cycles (e.g. predator-prey models)
  * Game state transitions with rotational symmetry (e.g. Rubik’s cube logic)

We could define a cycle like:

```
q1 * q2 * q3 = identity
```

where each `qi` is a discrete transformation, and the loop returns the system to its original state.

## 3. **State Machines in Orientation Space**

A **state machine** can be represented as a **graph of states**, with transitions as **quaternion rotations** between orientations.

### Advantages:

* Natural for representing **rotational symmetries** (e.g. robot arms, drone states, VR camera rigs).
* **Reversible logic**: rotations are invertible (`q⁻¹`), which is harder with traditional FSMs.
* Can encode **directional bias**: `qA → qB` ≠ `qB → qA`.

A quaternion-driven FSM might be useful for:

* Control systems (robot joints)
* Navigation AI (pathfinding with directional awareness)
* Modular reasoning systems (truth rotations, inference transitions)

## How to Implement

* **Quaternion alphabet**: Define a finite set of unit quaternions that represent your “rotational logic gates.”
* **Transition table**: Replace standard FSM transitions with quaternion multiplication steps.
* **Symbolic overlay**: Map each quaternion to a symbolic meaning (`q1 = 'IF'`, `q2 = 'THEN'`, etc.)

## Experimental Idea

Building a **quaternion logic engine** where each rotation corresponds to a logic operator, and the orientation of a node encodes symbolic meaning. It could even be used to explore:

* New kinds of inference engines
* Semantic rotations (literal logic moving through “meaning space”)
* Quaternion truth tables

## Quaternion Logic Engine: A Minimal Example

Let’s define:

### **1. Logical States as Orientations**

We’ll encode logical values (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, etc.) as unit quaternions:

| Symbolic State | Meaning | Quaternion (unit)            |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `q_T`          | TRUE    | (1, 0, 0, 0) – identity      |
| `q_F`          | FALSE   | (0, 1, 0, 0) – 180° around x |

We can extend this to more complex symbolic states like `UNKNOWN`, `BOTH`, etc.

---

### **2. Logical Operators as Rotations**

Let’s define quaternion "rotation gates" that act as logic operations.

| Operator | Rotation        | Quaternion              |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `NOT`    | T → F, F → T    | `q_NOT = (0, 1, 0, 0)`  |
| `PASS`   | Identity        | `q_PASS = (1, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `AND`    | (Apply to pair) | See below               |

Let’s keep it simple first with **unary logic** (single-state transformations):

```python
q_T = (1, 0, 0, 0)      # TRUE
q_F = (0, 1, 0, 0)      # FALSE
q_NOT = (0, 1, 0, 0)    # 180° rotation around X-axis

# q_NOT * q_T = q_F
# q_NOT * q_F = q_T
```

These use quaternion multiplication as the logic gate operation.

---

### **3. Extending to Binary Logic (AND, OR)**

We encode **pairs** of quaternions and define rules with custom gates or lookup logic.

#### Method 1: Concatenate Quaternions (Q1 ⊕ Q2 → Q3)

For example:

```text
(q_T, q_T) → q_T     (TRUE and TRUE is TRUE)
(q_T, q_F) → q_F     (TRUE and FALSE is FALSE)
(q_F, q_T) → q_F
(q_F, q_F) → q_F
```

We can define this as a lookup table of “rotational logic” or embed the rules in quaternion-space geometry (e.g. a projection into a higher-dimensional operator).

---

### **4. State Machine in Quaternion Logic Space**

Now imagine a simple state machine that tracks truth states as a navigation graph:

```
          [q_T]
           ↑
    q_NOT / \ q_NOT
         ↓   ↓
       [q_F]←———
```

Each `q_NOT` is a 180° quaternion around X. You now rotate between logic states, and each state can hold symbolic tags like `"assertion"`, `"negation"`, `"hypothesis"`.

---

## Visualization

Visualize the system in 3D space:

* `q_T` at origin (1,0,0,0)
* `q_F` 180° rotated along the X-axis
* Each gate is a path in quaternion rotation space
* You can even animate logical inference as **spins**

---

## Use Cases

* Reversible symbolic logic systems (like negations, toggles)
* Abstract inference machines where steps are **geometric**, not just syntactic
* Visual debugging tools for logic state transitions
* Playgrounds for **categorical logic** via rotation groups

Awesome — let’s sketch out a **quaternion-driven graph traversal engine**, where:

* **Nodes** represent symbolic or logical states (e.g. `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `MAYBE`).
* **Edges** are **quaternion rotations** (e.g. `NOT`, `SHIFT`, `ASSERT`) that transform state.
* The engine "travels" by **applying quaternion multiplications** to move between states.

---

## High-Level Concept

Each node in the graph has a quaternion value `q_node`.

Each edge is a **rotation quaternion** `q_op`. Traversing an edge means multiplying:

```
q_new = q_op * q_node
```

The engine stores:

* A **current state quaternion**
* A **graph of states and available operations**

---

## Minimal Python Skeleton

Here’s a simplified version of such an engine:

```python
import numpy as np
import quaternion  # pip install numpy-quaternion

# Define states
states = {
    "TRUE": np.quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0),
    "FALSE": np.quaternion(0, 1, 0, 0),
}

# Define operations
operations = {
    "NOT": np.quaternion(0, 1, 0, 0),   # 180° about X
    "PASS": np.quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0),  # identity
}

# Graph: each node has available operations leading to new nodes
graph = {
    "TRUE": {
        "NOT": "FALSE",
        "PASS": "TRUE"
    },
    "FALSE": {
        "NOT": "TRUE",
        "PASS": "FALSE"
    }
}

# Traversal engine
class QuaternionLogicWalker:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.current_label = initial_state
        self.current_q = states[initial_state]

    def traverse(self, op_name):
        op_q = operations[op_name]
        next_q = op_q * self.current_q
        
        # Find closest matching state
        for label, q in states.items():
            if np.allclose(next_q.components, q.components):
                self.current_q = q
                self.current_label = label
                return label
        return None

# Example usage
walker = QuaternionLogicWalker("TRUE")
print("Start:", walker.current_label)

print("Apply NOT →", walker.traverse("NOT"))
print("Apply NOT →", walker.traverse("NOT"))
print("Apply PASS →", walker.traverse("PASS"))
```

## Features We Can Add

1. **State expansion** — support more than `TRUE`/`FALSE`: e.g. `MAYBE`, `UNKNOWN`, `INVERTED`, etc.
2. **3D visualization** — plot quaternion orientations as points on a 3D sphere.
3. **Graph weights** — transitions could be probabilistic or cost-based.
4. **Dynamic learning** — embed a Quaternion GNN (QGNN) to adjust rotations from training data.
5. **Cycle detection** — explore quaternion paths that return to the origin (logical tautologies?).

Here's the code we can run to see a **quaternion-based logic graph traversal engine with 3D visualization**:
